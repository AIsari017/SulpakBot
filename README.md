**User Query:**
“Recommend me an air conditioner for a small office.”

**Bot Response:**
The bot analyzes the query and provides a tailored recommendation:

- Suggests the ARG CSH-09BA air conditioner, mentioning its suitability for small office spaces, affordability, and technical specifications like cooling capacity and area coverage.
- Provides a direct link to the product on Sulpak's website for further details and purchase.
- Includes summarized specifications, such as warranty, brand, cooling power, and recommended room size.

## Features
- Real-Time Recommendations: The bot fetches product information and delivers tailored suggestions based on user queries.
- Product Filtering: Ensures results are accurate, relevant, and based on user-defined criteria like price, category, and quality.
- Natural Language Processing: Handles user questions such as:

"What is the best cheap aircon for my bedroom?"
